🚀 Vision

A free AI medical assistant for every human being — offline, real-time, and globally accessible.
A world where a child in a flood shelter, an astronaut in orbit, or a farmer in a remote village can check essential health metrics instantly… without hospitals, internet, or cost barriers.

> “Courage and obsession can beat anything — and no one has the dare to stop me.”
— Rifah Tasnia Orthi, Founder
